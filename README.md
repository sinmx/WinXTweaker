## An introduction/story
 We all now the Windows OS(perhaps you're maybe reading this sentence on it).  
We also know how difficult it is to tweak Windows(Because it's closed source).  

But luckely we have the Registry,a place full of keys and values,that allows us to tweak the look and feel of Windows.  
Before I was running Windows,I was using Linux(Deepin Os).  

With Linux I just fell in love with the possibility's to tweak the interface and code to my own liking and it brought my experience(as a user) to a whole new level.  

When switching to Windows, I honestly felt quite disappointed about the limited settings I was getting.  
So I quickly installed another Browser(Because Edge is sh*t) and searched online for a few tweaks that I could use.  

As I thought there were a lot websites that had actually a lot of tweaks that you could use,most of them said that you needed to open _"regedit"_(This was like Chinese for me as a Windows beginner) and do a lot of heisa in it.  

So I read a lot of articles and watched a lot of Youtube videos about the "famous" Registry.  

Then I thought to myself,"Does it really need to be so difficult?".

So I desided to take my own route and write my own tool that will house some popular tweaks.

And because there was only one programming language that I was familiar with,I decided to write my tool in C++.

So I fired up Visual Studio after a very long installation and started to code.
So yeah,here's my tool.

## Compatibility

* Windows 10  
It can happen that some tweaks don't work on older versions of Windows 10,but I assume that you are running the latest version. 

* All CPU archictures(although I didn't tested WXT on 32-bit CPU's yet.)

You may ask why I'm only supporting Windows 10,first of all the X in Win**X**Tweaker means 10 (Roman Alphabet)
and my intention was to make this tool only for Windows 10 (Note that some tweaks can actually work on Win7/8/8.1 but I don't give support).

## Giving feedback / Proposing tweaks / Reporting bugs

* If you want to give me feedback or propose tweaks, don't worry about sending me a mail(My e-mail is _libert1quinten@gmail.com_) and please don't spam me!

* If you want to report a bug,then you can use the Issue's page on this Repo.

* Sorry if there are any typo's in my text or code(comments) because I'm not a native English speaker(I speak Dutch),and also feel free to correct them.

## Contributing to WXT
If you want to contribute,first of all,thanks!.
My intention of this tool was to make it free and opensource, so contribution would be great!

* **Make sure to read the Wiki(Under Construction), for easy steps to understand and contribute to my code.**
